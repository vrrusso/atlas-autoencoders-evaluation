# ATLAS deep autoencoders evaluation
This is a short jupyter notebook analizing the performance of a deep auto encoder neural network compressing the data from ATLAS experiment.

This work is done under the context of a evaluation task for Google of Summer 2021. Here you can find the main notebook(evaluation.ipynb) containing the data preparation and the training and evaluation of the network.

You can also find the dataset in it's original form(.csv) and a pdf explaining it's content(dataset.pdf); a short slide presentation on the work(press.pdf) and a short motivation for choosing this project(motivation.md).
