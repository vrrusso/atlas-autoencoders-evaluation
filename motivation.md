# Short Motivation
My major academic interests are machine learning and the possible application of it in other science fields. So, when I have read the description of the ATLAS deep auto encoder project in HSF website, I was thrilled with the possibility of working with scientists that are part of the LHC, specially in a project with machine learning.

So, I hope to learn a lot from this process(I have already had) and contribute with this exciting field that is computer science applied to high energy particle physics.
